# Social Network Connectivity

Given a social network containing `n` members and a log file 
containing `m` timestamps at which times pairs of members formed  
friendships , design an algorithm to determine the earliest time  
at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).  
Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that the friendship is an equivalence relation.  
The running time of algorithm should be `m log n` or better and use of extra space is proportional to `n`
