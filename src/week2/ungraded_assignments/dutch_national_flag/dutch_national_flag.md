# Dutch National Flag Problem 
## (3 way partitioning )

Given an array of n buckets , each containing a red , white or blue pebble  
sort them by color.  
The allowed operations are :

- swap (i,j) : swap the pebble in position i with pebble at position j
- color(i) : determine the color of pebble in bucket i

The performance requirements :

- At most n calls to color()
- At most n calls to swap()
- constant extra space
